# Zendesk - Orcanos Integration 
This project is meant to manage Zendesk tickets and publish them as work items in Orcanos. This replaces what usually was done on Zapier and will accomplish the following:

 - Publish "Sync to Orcanos" tickets to Orcanos.
 - Assigning a work item ID to a ticket once published.
 - Updating work items as soon as tickets are updated.
 - Sending updates to support from Orcanos to Zendesk.
