# Zendesk - Orcanos Integration 
This project is meant to manage Zendesk tickets and publish them as work items in Orcanos. This accomplishes the following:

 - Publish "Sync to Orcanos" tickets to Orcanos.
 - Assigning a work item ID to a ticket once published.
 - Updating work items as soon as tickets are updated.
 - Sending updates to support from Orcanos to Zendesk.
